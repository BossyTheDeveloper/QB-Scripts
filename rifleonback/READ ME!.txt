A very simple weapon on back script which adds a carbine rifle prop onto your back, even if you have a assault rifle equipped.
This is achieved by holding your weapon and typing /attachweapon in which a confimation will appear in the chat box as well as the weapon appearing on your back
The limitations of my coding knowledge at this point hinder me from making it equip the right weapon on the back. 
Feel free to alter my code and create changes, i would like credit for the original creation if the code was changed.
Thanks, Bossy
